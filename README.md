# Summer-Internship-2018

## Reuben Varghese:
### Updates until July 17th:

* Deployed ManageIq on an AWS server as my local workstation does not have enough
resources to effectively run the application.
* Understood the working of models and the use, usage of pytest framework in
running integration tests on ManageIq
* Successfully installed Selenium over VNC and also setup the testing environment
for running ManageIq integration tests. Unfortunately, since the resources are
limited locally, I plan to redo the installation on my AWS server that houses
ManageIq currently.
